click the load button on the source panel and the source panel should take the text from the text box and insert it into the memory
panel where you can see the text code. Then it will try its hardest to translate the code to assembly and place it in the assembly code 
text box. click the load button on the assembly code panel to start the program. 


Project is incomplete.
All of the opcodes are working as intended. cmp, jmp, in, out, je, jne, jg,jl, jge,jle, lea,inc,dec, set. added op code would be set, which takes an register and a variable. it allows you to store the varibale value into the register.

 The assembly code might not to completly right. auto translations does not work completely so the assembly code will be manually entered.
